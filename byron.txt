Oh, thou art fairer than the evening air
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars;
Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
When he appears to make the nations start;
And when thou smilest, oh, seraphic sight!
In heaven itself we can but faintly trace
Some feeble glimpses of thy dazzling light,
Which sheds its radiance o'er thy beauteous face.
Yet not alone thy outward charms we love,
But for that gentler grace which fills thy soul,
The virtue, purity, and truth that move
Our hearts to worship thee and thee extol.
So may thy life be passed in joy and peace,
And when thou diest, may all thy sorrows cease.
